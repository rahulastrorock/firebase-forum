            A forum website is an important social networking tool included in a
            web application, to facilitate interaction and collaboration with
            the users. Our project will provide a platform for University
            Students and their Respective Faculties to convey their messages and
            thoughts about anything related to the University no matter what the
            topics. The different topics will have different categories to write
            in and share their perception. Faculty will have admin control which
            means they could post without any permission. Hence for students,
            they will have user control which means they could write anything
            but their written blog will first go to the admin from whom the post
            could be deleted, edited, or posted on the blog.
